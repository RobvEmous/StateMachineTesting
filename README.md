# State Machine Testing of TLS protocol implementations

This repository contains a simple setup for learning Mealy machine models of different TLS implementations using the L* algorithm.
It makes use of LearnLib (http://learnlib.de/), a library for active model learning. On top of that, we use the software made by Joeri de Ruiter
